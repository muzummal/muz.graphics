					<h2>...Cook</h2>
					<p>Smashed burgers are life. I love to go for themes when making a burger, but also some creative items like Pistachio Butter Burger. I have my sights on
					making my own bread so I can make the perfect burger starting with the buns.</p>

				<div class="aboutme-cat">
					<h2>...Song Collector</h2>
					<p>Embarrasingly, I might have more playlists than songs. But Category is everything. I have playlists for moods, inspiration, remixes, genres, and
					even stories. Currently my favorites are Glass Animals, Abhi the Nomad, and Belly.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="aboutme-cat">
					<h2>...Book Worm</h2>
					<p>The main reason I got into reading was because of the 3rd Harry Potter movie. It confused me with what felt like gaps in the story, so I read the
					3rd book, then the first two and onwards to the other books as they were released. </p>

					<h2>...Movie Enthusiast</h2>
					<p>Symbolic meanings in movies are such a treat. Noticing foreshadowing, and seeing where the movie went wrong with pacing are just some of the
					things I really enjoy while watching a movie. Disecting the meaning after the movie and simply taking in the story makes movies amazing. That being
					said, I hate critics.</p>

					<h2>...Gamer</h2>
					<p>Lately I feel like I can only play games with a character creator. Mostly because it feels more personal and as if I am writing a story for my
					own character. I am also trying really hard not to play Baulder Gate 3 again, and am waiting for Monster Hunter Wyld. Eventually, I would like to
					take the time out to make my own game.</p>

					<h2>...Writer</h2>
					<p>DnD is an awesome tool to write stories. There are books I have read that feel like a DnD adventure </p>
