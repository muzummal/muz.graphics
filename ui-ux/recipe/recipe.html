					<h3>Summary</h3>
					<p>Recipe Box is an app to help users organize their recipes, get their macros, get new ideas,
						and share with friends.
						The app’s ultimate purpose is organization of recipes, specifically for anyone who likes to
						cook and meal prep. Though
						the limitations would not end there and could be used for anyone looking for inspiration,
						learning to cook, or get
						nutritional information.</p>
					<p>Recipe Box needs to create a recipe management app that allows users to create, and share
						recipes with ease.</p>

				<div class="col-four">
					<h3>Research</h3>
					<p>I started researching with interviews from a focus group. I asked people who are both
						professional and normal home cooks:</p>
					<ul class="list">
						<li>Do you Consider yourself a Food Enthusiast?</li>
						<li>Do you use recipes, why or why not?</li>
						<li>How do you save recipes that you like?</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="col-four card-two hidden reveal">
					<h4>Pain Points</h4>
					<ul class="list">
						<li>Recipe yield increases can be difficult to calculate with lots of ingredients</li>
						<li>Keeping track of nutrition can be a hassle with all the nutrient information, calorie
							intake, protein and carbs</li>
						<li>Finding substitutes and where you can buy those substitutes</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="col-four">
					<h3>Competitive Audit</h3>
					<p>I looked at similar apps, and although they offer recipe management, they focus heavily on
						other goals or do not offer the
						extensive recipe management abilities. I want to create this app so the recipe’s come first.
						I feel this way creating recipes
						would be easier in comparison to other apps.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-four">
					<h3>Personas</h3>
					<p>I discussed this topic with close friends and colleagues who were willing
						to help me with testing and research. I used the information I gathered to
						create personas.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-three card-two hidden reveal">
					<h4>Leslie</h4>
					<p>Leslie loves her job and is a very organized person. Her organization allows her to get a lot
						done. She finds that recipes are a
						great way to keep consistency, but has a hard time making sure she is eating properly and
						finding substitutes either for dietary
						reasons or because of allergy concerns.</p>
					<p><strong>Goals</strong></p>
					<ul class="list">
						<li>Wants to keep recipes in one location</li>
						<li>Wants to easily understand nutritional information</li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>Frustrations</strong></p>
					<ul class="list">
						<li>Not having recipes easily accessible</li>
						<li>Not being able to find substitutes</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="col-three card-two hidden reveal">
					<h4>Demitree</h4>
					<p>Demitree is a smart guy who learns fast. His goal in life is to be a concept artist, but
						falls on being a graphic designer in
						order to make money. Another goal that he is also focused on is staying in shape and
						building muscle mass. He understands working
						out, but nutrition can be more difficult.</p>
					<p><strong>Goals</p></strong>
					<ul class="list">
						<li>Wants to keep track of protein intake</li>
						<li>Working on bulking then cutting</li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>Frustrations</p></strong>
					<ul class="list">
						<li>Not being able to get enough protein in a day</li>
						<li>Recipe suggestions not personal</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<div class="col-four">
					<h3>Insight</h3>
					<p>A need to understand the nutritional breakdown of recipes is very important among users.
						Although creating a place to store recipes
						is the primary goal, a well read nutritional page is also going to be important to users.

				<h2 id="" class="col-six">Product Design</h2>

				<div class="col-four">
					<p>The product is designed to store and create recipes so they are easy to access, but also
						provide a way to increase or decrease the
						yield results, serving size, and nutritional information. The main page would be a feed that
						would inspire the user to take recipes
						that have been shared with the public and make it their own. It also would encourage the
						user to dive in and create a recipe of their
						own. The colors of the design would give fresh food vibes with vibrant greens and oranges to
						promote an environment of health first.</p>

				<h2 id="" class="col-six">Testing</h2>
				<div class="col-four">
					<h3>Usability Study</h3>
					<p>When testing the users, I have supervised them in these tests to see if there were
						expectations that I did not expect. Also
						to see if some of the UI met the experience I was hoping for since I was trying a few things
						that felt new to me.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-four card-two hidden reveal">
					<h4>Questions and Tasks</h4>
					<ul class="list">
						<li>
							<p>What would you click to create a new recipe?</p>
							<ul class="list">
								<li>Would that be the process you normally take?</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Are the icons easily readable?</li>
						<li>
							<p>How would you see the nutritional information of a recipe you created?</p>
							<ul class="list">
								<li>Is there something you would like to see that would make it easier for
									organizing or creating recipes?</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="col-four">
					<h3>Results</h3>
					<p>A mistake I had made was trying to create a lot more variation of pages than I needed to. For
						each saved recipe, I had tried
						to make an example of what it would look like. During the testing, I realized I couldn’t
						test all the features and needed to
						focus on testing one feature at a time before moving onto the next. I should have focused on
						creating recipes, organization,
						and nutritional information.</p>
					<p>This is something I had corrected moving onto the hi-fi prototype. I’ve also added color to
						the hi-fi design to convey the
						vibe of a healthy environment and goals. I’ve included more animations to give a better feel
						of how the app would move and feel.</p>

				<div class="col-four">
					<h3>Mock Ups</h3>
					<p>Prototyping helped me find a few issues I did not want to carry over to a hi-fi prototype.
						One thing that was noted to me
						was the users expected to see an edit button. Managing a recipe would be pointless if you
						could not edit the recipe itself.</p>
					<p>Another point a user had made was there was no feedback when an action was made. Going
						forward, I would use animations in
						the lofi prototype only to show user feedback and focus less on creating more pages. I would
						keep the animations simple and
						refine those for the hi-fi prototype.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="col-four">
					<h3>Accessibility</h3>
					<p>I really wanted to focus on the sandwich menu with icons that made sense. However this will
						cause an accessibility issue if someone
						does not understand the icons. To counter this, I think a web based application would be
						helpful and accessibility options at initial
						setup of the application.</p>

				<h2 id="" class="col-six">Conclusion</h2>
				<div class="col-four">
					<h3>Take Away</h3>
					<p>Going through the user testing on the mock ups allowed me to see the importance of user
						feedback. For a lo-fi prototype, it isn’t
						necessary to create all the pages, but the key features needed to get a better idea of what
						the application offers.</p>
					<p>The process in testing and designing and refining allowed me to learn how I can make future
						tests easier for the user, to
						keep accessibility in mind, and not to worry too much about the next step.</p>

					<h3>Final Design</h3>
					<iframe class="figma-recipe-embed"
						src="https://embed.figma.com/proto/2LgZaPlFI2qz2EMdblrFrT/RecipeMGMT_Wireframe-2.0?node-id=1-3&node-type=canvas&scaling=scale-down&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=1%3A3&embed-host=share&hide-ui=1"
						allowfullscreen></iframe>
				</div>
				<div class="col-four">
					<h3>Next Steps</h3>
					<p>My next steps would be to create and test the design for the key features such as an overview
						page of the recipes, nutrition
						page, and sharing recipes. I would also like to see a dark mode and how this design would
						translate into a web application.</p>
