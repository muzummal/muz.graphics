					<h3>Summary</h3>
					<p>This project's purpose is primarily to familiarize myself with the U.S. Web Design System.</p>
					<p>NIBIB's webpage is about 3-4 years old. Although they have implemented some elements from the
						USWDS,
						there are a few areas of improvement and better integration options.</p>

					<h3>Research</h3>
					<p>My research consisted of diving into the USWDS’s website. I wanted to understand their goals,
						process, and designs.
						Learning how the design system operated together was interesting, but also looking at where I
						can adjust the webpage
						to make it more personal to NIBIB.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-four">
					<h3>Competitive Audit</h3>
					<p>I have looked at a few other websites already implementing the USWDS. It was actually where I
						started this project,
						because I was choosing which website I wanted to redesign. I saw how some websites used the
						system, and where they
						broke away in some areas to fit the needs of their organization.</p>

				<div class="col-four">
					<h3>Wireframes</h3>
					<p>The best way to get ideas out for the redesign was still wireframes. It allowed me to draw out
						how I felt the
						layout should be and mix and match ideas later in the process. I even referred to my drawings
						when creating the
						digital wireframes.</p>

					<h3>Accessibility</h3>
					<p>One of USWDS’s goal is to be more accessible. Therefore it has specific rules you have to follow.
						One of the pages I wanted to
						make was a page with a form, so I created a contact page where the user could fill out a form to
						contact NIBIB. I also kept other
						forms of contact, such as email, phone number, address, and links that provide detailed
						directions.</p>

				<h2 id="conclusion" class="col-six">Conclusion</h2>
				<div class="col-four">
					<h3>Take Away</h3>
					<p>My takeaway is that a design system can be very helpful and can keep you organized. With a big
						organization such as NIH and all
						of it’s branches such as NIBIB, it is easy for the websites to look messy and unkempt. With the
						design system starting to take place,
						you can see all of the websites become more cohesive with a slight flair of their own.</p>
					<p>I did not completely change everything, so it was not entirely a from-scratch project. I kept in
						mind that this layout and order
						was in place for a reason and chose to keep elements as close to their original location as
						possible. A lot of the things I have
						applied to NIBIB was a combination of the USWDS and from learning the standards of web design at
						NIEHS.</p>

					<h3>Final Design</h3>
					<iframe class="figma-embed"
						src="https://embed.figma.com/proto/3t21wzfUIT66ae7wsqVa5W/Wireframe_NIBIB?node-id=23-155&node-type=frame&scaling=scale-down-width&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=23%3A154&starting-point-node-id=23%3A155&embed-host=share&hide-ui=1"
						allowfullscreen></iframe>
				</div>
				<div class="col-four">
					<h3>Next Steps</h3>
					<p>The next step is to send NIBIB an email and show them areas they can improve and areas they have
						done well. Another next step I
						would like to take is to create a Web Design System of my own. I would also like to test the use
						of the website and how people use
						it so that I could be better prepared to update the designs.</p>
