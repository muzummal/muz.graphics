					<h2 id="overview" class="col-six">Overview</h2>
					<div class="col-four">
						<h3>Summary</h3>
						<p>Baji was created to be a template to offer curriculum programs as well as an infrastructure template. The main core of Baji is
						meant for younger muslims to get guidance from an older sister/brother like figure.</p>
						<h3>Key Challenge</h3>
						<p>The Baji brand needs a website for commuinities that could use help in building outreach programs and to showcase
						the curriculum Baji has to offer.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-two">
						<h3>Role</h3>
						<p>Product Designer</p>
						<ul class="list">
							<li>User Research</li>
							<li>Interaction</li>
							<li>Visual Design</li>
							<li>Prototyping</li>

						<h3>Target</h3>
						<p>Muslim communities</p>
					</div>
					
					<h2 id="understand" class="col-six">Understand</h2>
					<div class="col-four">
						<h3>Research</h3>
						<p>I started researching with interviews from a focus group. I asked members of muslim communities questions like:</p>
						<ul class="list">
							<li>What do they feel like is missing in their communities?</li>
							<li>If they could have one thing in their community, what would it be?</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Competitive Audit</h3>
						<p>When conducting the research, I looked at how community ran programs tend to function. Most of the models were
						self run with a guidance on how to start your own branch. I thought this would be great model to use because it 
						would allow the community to decide what they are lacking.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="col-two">
						<h3>Pain Points</h3>
						<ul class="list">
							<li>There is no community engagement from masjids and Islamic centers.</li>
							<li>The programs for kids are limited to just one activity.</li>
							<li>Events for the whole family would bring the families in the community together isntead of waiting for a holiday.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					
					<div class="col-six">
						<h3>Personas</h3>
						<p>After a few interviews, I was able to construct a few personas based on the community.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="col-four">

						<h3>Insight</h3>
						<p>A lot of muslim communites would like to have outreach and family oriented programs but lack the organizational skills and tools.</p>
					</div>
					
					<h2 id="product-design" class="col-six">Product Design</h2>
					
					<div class="col-four">
						<p>I started the layout with the idea that I would want a splash image. Each page would have a person who the user
						would feel represents them. I also had to consider ways to have the layout best convey the information in an easy
						to read manner. Lastly, I had to keep in mind the difference in pages and what they had to offer. The About page
						would be different from the Programs page.</p>

						<h3>Lofi Prototype</h3>

					<h2 id="testing" class="col-six">Testing</h2>
					<div class="col-four">
						<h3>Usability Study</h3>
						<p>The study I have conducted was unsupervised with a list of tasks and a list of questions. In doing so,
						I learned a few drawbacks as well as a few positives that helped me understand the direction this project
						needed to go.</p>
						<h3>Results</h3>
						<p>From the lofi prototype testing I learned a few things that made a impact on this project and projects to come.</p>
						<p>One of the things I learned is that it would be more helpful for users to get a grasp of what the product is about 
						even if it had text that was not finished instead of mock up text such as Lorem Ipsum.</p>
						<p>Another point that really had stuck out to me was the page layout themselves felt like to the users they were completely
						different pages. Even though this was just a wireframe, I think the layout of the pages were not consistant.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-two">
						<h4>Tasks Example</h4>
						<p>What would you click to get to the Programs page?</p>
						<h4>Questions Example</h4>
						<p>What are your thoughts on accessing the Programs page</p>
					</div>
					<h2 id="refining" class="col-six">Refining</h2>
					<div class="col-four">
						<h3>Mock Ups</h3>
						<p>Taking what I learned from the results, I went to implement those changes into my design. Everytime I move from
						wireframe to the first mock up it is another learning experience. I saw a few places where I had to make changes
						in order for the design to make sense or to be readable.</p>

					</div>
					
					<div class="col-four">
						<h3>Accessibility</h3>
						<p>In the design process I was able to find a few errors in the design that caused an accessibility problem. Particularly
						the navigation menu being difficult yo read. My original plan when making the wireframe was to make the text white so that
						it would contrast the image, but I did not consider parts of the image being a lighter color.</p>
						<p>I created a smooth fade to prevent the image from making it difficult to read and kept with the black on white background.
						This also helped the logo and the account icon. Accessibility to some, is accessibility to all, however, making the navigation
						items easier to read was a great choice.</p>
					</div>
					
					<h2 id="conclusion" class="col-six">Conclusion</h2>
					<div class="col-four">
						<h3>Take Away</h3>
						<p>Taking this old design concept I made and turning it into an actual product was a fun project, but it was also a good
						learning experience. Taking notes from what the user base needs and wants are allowed me to find better accessibilty options,
						make a more unifying experience, and a product that is functional yet true the brand.</p>
						<p>The process in testing and designing and refining allowed me to learn how I can make future tests easier for the user, to
						keep accessibility in mind, and not to worry too much about the next step.</p>
						<h3>Final Design</h3>
						<div class="img-placeholder"></div>
						<div class="spacer"></div>
						<h3>Next Steps</h3>
						<p>The next steps for this project would be to design a mobile page. I had created a webpage because I felt like that is where
						someone would go to start the process of signing up or starting their own branch. However, it is not tested and users still may
						want to access the information through their phone for reference when discussing the possibility of signing up or starting a branch.</p>
