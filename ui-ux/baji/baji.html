					<h3>Summary</h3>
					<p>Baji was created to be an outline to offer curriculum programs as well as an infrastructure
						template.
						The main core of Baji is meant for younger muslims to get guidance from an older
						sister/brother like figure.</p>
					<p>The Baji brand needs a website for communities that could use help in building outreach
						programs and to
						showcase the curriculum Baji has to offer.</p>

					<h3>Research</h3>
					<p>I started researching with interviews from a focus group. I asked members of muslim
						communities questions like:</p>
					<ul class="list">
						<li>What do they feel like is missing in their communities?</li>
						<li>If they could have one thing in their community, what would it be?</li>
					</ul>
					<h4>Pain Points</h4>
					<ul class="list">
						<li>There is no community engagement from masjids and Islamic centers.</li>
						<li>The programs for kids are limited to just one activity.</li>
						<li>Events for the whole family would bring the families in the community together instead
							of waiting for a holiday.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="col-four">
					<h3>Competitive Audit</h3>
					<p>When conducting the research, I looked at how community run programs tend to function. Most
						of the models were
						self run with guidance on how to start your own branch. I thought this would be a great
						model to use because it would
						allow the community to decide what they are lacking.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="col-four">
					<h3>Personas</h3>
					<p>After a few interviews, I was able to construct a few personas based on people I interviewed
						from Islamic communities.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-three card-two">
					<h4>Samaya</h4>
					<p>Samaya is a recent college graduate who just came back from volunteer work with the United
						Nations. She wants to do more for her community but has a hard time finding resources that
						she can use to grow programs. She also is not sure how to begin to bring together a community.
						<br /><br />
					</p>
					<p><strong>Goals</p></strong>
					<ul class="list">
						<li>Find a way to create a community based on Islamic values</li>
						<li>Have resources and a structure she can use to organize activities</li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>Frustrations</p></strong>
					<ul class="list">
						<li>Not knowing where to begin in starting a community</li>
						<li>Having to create activities from scratch</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="col-three card-two">
					<h4>Ebrahim</h4>
					<p>Ebrahim wants to move to a new city in the US. He is not worried about finding a job, because
						he works remotely. What he does
						want to do is find a city with a good community. Doing searches on popular search engines
						turn up results with mosques and
						populations count, but he does not know much about the communities themselves.<br /><br /></p>
					<p><strong>Goals</p></strong>
					<ul class="list">
						<li>Find a community in a city where he can move to</li>
						<li>Find a community that aligns with his values</li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>Frustrations</p></strong>
					<ul class="list">
						<li>Search engines provide a place to start, but not details</li>
						<li>Disorganization of local communities</li>

						the difference in pages and what they had to offer.</p>

					<h3>Usability Study</h3>
					<p>The study I have conducted was unsupervised with a list of tasks and a list of questions. In
						doing so, I learned a
						few drawbacks as well as a few positives that helped me understand the direction this
						project needed to go.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-four card-two">
					<h4>Questions and Tasks</h4>
					<ul class="list">
						<li>
							<p>What would you click to get to the Programs page?</p>
							<ul class="list">
								<li>Can you tell me what programs are offered?</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Is the information easily readable?</li>
						<li>What are your thoughts on accessing the Programs page?</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="col-four">
					<h3>Results</h3>
					<p>From the lofi prototype testing I learned a few things that made an impact on this project
						and projects to come.</p>
					<p>One of the things I learned is that it would be more helpful for users to get a grasp of what
						the product is about
						even if it had text that was not finished instead of mock up text such as Lorem Ipsum.</p>
					<p>Another point that really had stuck out to me was the page layout themselves felt like to the
						users they were completely
						different pages. Even though this was just a wireframe, I think the layout of the pages were
						not consistent.</p>

				<div class="col-four">
					<h3>Mock Ups</h3>
					<p>Taking what I learned from the results, I went to implement those changes into my design.
						Everytime I move from wireframe
						to the first mock up it is another learning experience. I saw a few places where I had to
						make changes in order for the design
						to make sense or to be readable.</p>

					<h3>Accessibility</h3>
					<p>In the design process I was able to find a few errors in the design that caused an
						accessibility problem. Particularly the
						navigation menu being difficult to read. My original plan when making the wireframe was to
						make the text white so that it would
						contrast the image, but I did not consider parts of the image to be a lighter color.</p>
					<p>I created a smooth fade to prevent the image from making it difficult to read and kept with
						the black on white background.
						This also helped the logo and the account icon. Accessibility to some, is accessibility to
						all, however, making the navigation
						items easier to read was a great choice.</p>

				<div class="col-four">
					<h3>Take Away</h3>
					<p>Taking this old design concept I made and turning it into an actual product was a fun
						project, but it was also a good learning
						experience. Taking notes from what the user base needs and wants allowed me to find better
						accessibility options, make a more
						unifying experience, and a product that is functional yet true to the brand.</p>
					<p>The process in testing and designing and refining allowed me to learn how I can make future
						tests easier for the user, to keep
						accessibility in mind, and not to worry too much about the next step.</p>

					</iframe>
				</div>
				<div class="col-four">
					<h3>Next Steps</h3>
					<p>The next steps for this project would be to design a mobile page. I had created a webpage
						because I felt like that is where
						someone would go to start the process of signing up or starting their own branch. However,
						it is not tested and users still may
						want to access the information through their phone for reference when discussing the
						possibility of signing up or starting a branch.</p>
