					<h3>Summary</h3>
					<p>NIEHS consistently develops and updates content and design. After joining
						the NIEHS team as a Content Strategist, I moved into a UI/UX position.
						My skills and experience developed across these two roles are showcased
						in the four projects presented. In the following projects you will see
						web page updates that improve user experience, making them more user
						friendly and the application of U.S. Web Design System (USWDS) with an
						updated modern design.

				<div class="col-four">
					<h3>Top Level Pages &ndash; Design Options</h3>
					<p>The goal of re-designing the top level pages was to follow the USWDS as
						a requirement of U.S. a Government run website. The USWDS goal is to
						make websites more accessible and mobile-friendly. The stakeholder’s
						request was also to give users access to lower level pages.
					</p>
					<p><strong>Option 1</strong> &ndash; A clean and modern design concept with
						most of the emphasis on the child pages. This concept helps users
						navigate faster to their destination. This option also has special
						containers to better highlight sections such as Hot Topics.
					</p>
					<p><strong>Option 2</strong> &ndash; A straight-forward concept where the
						emphasis is placed on the child pages two levels down allowing the user
						a better visual of the site map further increasing navigation. The
						layout allows the user to understand the hierarchy while keeping the
						page short which helps them get to their destination faster. This option
						condenses special containers into call out boxes that reside in a column
						right of the main content.

					<h2>Redesign Graphics and Web Pages for CHORDS</h2>
					<p>Connecting Health Outcomes Research and Data Systems (CHORDS) is a
						branch of NIEHS. The department’s software was hosted on GitHub
						and needed to be re-organized on NIEHS’ pages to increase ease of
						access and to provide a summary of each application. Additionally,
						they requested a new design language that incorporated musical
						themes.
					</p>
					<p>We presented three options and a few extra suggestions to meet the
						client’s criteria. Each suggestion carefully considered the scientist’s
						use and needs such as software status and graphics.

					<h3>Comparative Medicine Branch &ndash; Standard Operating Procedures Web Application</h3>
					<p>The Comparative Medicine Branch (CMB) wrote and compiled the Standard
						Operating Procedures (SOPs). The NIEHS scientist and department
						administrators use the search application to filter through the
						organized SOPs.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-four card-two hidden reveal">
					<p><strong>Problem</strong> - The CMB and other department staff were having
						trouble using the search application created to filter SOPs.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-four card-two hidden reveal">
					<p><strong>Research</strong> - Our team tested the search application
						features by observing the scientists and administrators usage methods to
						find SOPs. We observed the staff in a remote setting where they were
						required to complete a user task list. The users were also asked to share
						their reasoning on the decisions they made throughout completing the
						tasks. This allowed us to ask follow up questions which helped us to
						discover problems we have not considered.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-four card-two hidden reveal">
					<p><strong>Findings</strong> - We found that most users used the website's
						search engine, bookmarked the page, or skipped the applications search
						feature to manually search through the list provided by the application.
						We found that both users who knew what they were looking for and those
						who didn’t would still avoid the search bar feature.
					</p>
					<p><strong>Pain Points:</strong></p>
					<ul class="list">
						<li>Uninformed about SOP updates</li>
						<li>Unable to find SOP revision dates</li>
						<li>Found search filter options unhelpful</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="col-four niehs-card hidden reveal">
					<p><strong>Solutions</strong> - The CMB SOP application was updated to 
						include a “New” or “Updated” icon on new or recently updated SOPs. We 
						also changed the SOP pages to clearly show revised dates by moving it 
						higher on the page’s hierarchy. We also implemented a mailing system 
						to send update notifications to users when they follow an SOP.
					</p>
					<p>The search bar function was improved on the backend to better handle 
						keywords entered in the search bar. Also suggestions were made by our 
						team to improve the description of the SOPs’ titles to better match 
						the content.
					</p>
					<p>
						Lastly, we updated the search filter options to match more precisely 
						with both scientists’ and administrators’ needs. The new list was more 
						accurate because it consisted of suggestions made by both groups.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-four">
					<h3>Top Tasks List</h3>
					<p>The Top Task list is a list on a private government webpage that takes 
						users to commonly used tasks and webpages. Both scientists and 
						administrative users under NIEHS would use the top task list to get to 
						their destination faster.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-four card-two hidden reveal">
					<p><strong>Problem</strong> - The Top Tasks list has a list of items that 
						users find inconvenient or difficult to find on the list.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-four card-two hidden reveal">
					<p><strong>Research</strong> - We interviewed multiple NIEHS staff that 
						included both scientists and administrators. After we discovered a major 
						issue from testing the original list, we started to do A/B Testing. 
						Group A were tested with a naming convention that listed actions to take 
						and Group B were tested with a naming convention that listed the 
						destination names.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-four card-two hidden reveal">
					<p><strong>Findings</strong> - Users, old and new alike, were frustrated 
						with the Top Task links because they were disorganized and poorly 
						written. Group B performed their task completion at a much faster rate 
						in comparison to the original list and Group A.
					</p>
					<p><strong>Pain Points:</strong></p>
					<ul class="list">
						<li>Inconsistencies in link’s naming convention</li>
						<li>Abbreviations were not known to new users</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="col-four niehs-card hidden reveal">
					<p><strong>Solution</strong> - The solution to these problems were simple and 
						streamlined. First, all the links were changed to the webpage’s title or 
						application’s name. Second, abbreviations were listed in the format: 
						abbreviation dash abbreviation written out. With consistency and a good 
						naming convention, the task list reduced time to complete tasks 
						effectively.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-four">
					<h3>Recycle Guide</h3>
					<p>The Recycle Guide was a requested application to help users properly 
						recycle material waste. The criteria for the application was to have 
						the ability to use search filters to find the relevant recyclable 
						materials and obtain information on how to recycle those materials.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-four card-two hidden reveal">
					<p><strong>Problem</strong> - NIEHS Staff needed an application that made 
						it easier than the current recycling guide on how to recycle materials 
						on campus.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-four card-two hidden reveal">
					<p><strong>Research</strong> - After multiple discussions with the 
						stakeholders we were able to determine the users’ high level needs. With 
						that information we had created a prototype which we used to test the 
						potential user base.
					</p>
					<p>
						We examined users with the prototype allowing us to make a few notable 
						discoveries. After a few iterations with the prototype and further 
						observations we were able to tackle pain points as well as solutions that 
						fit the needs of the stakeholder and the NIEHS staff.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-four card-two hidden reveal">
					<p><strong>Findings</strong> - The scientist who would use the recycling 
						guide prototype brought up concerns that have not been identified. 
						Primarily, the search filters and recycling instructions for used 
						materials were not as helpful because the location changed factors in 
						the recycling process. Also we learned it would be helpful to know how 
						to dispose items that cannot be recycled.</p>
					<p><strong>Pain Points:</strong></p>
					<ul class="list">
						<li>Did not know where to recycle material</li>
						<li>Could not find instructions on disposing nonrecyclables</li>
						<li>Were confused by instructions because it did not match work environment</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="col-four niehs-card hidden reveal">
					<p><strong>Solutions</strong> - After a few iterations and retesting with 
						users and stakeholders, we separated recyclable and nonrecyclable items 
						and provided appropriate instructions to each card. The card itself 
						provided quick information that was commonly needed and the card’s 
						expansion feature included additional detailed information including how 
						and where to recycle materials.</p>
					<p>To address the recycling location concerns, we adjusted filters based on 
						location. This helped tremendously and reduced the task completion rate 
						during user testing.
