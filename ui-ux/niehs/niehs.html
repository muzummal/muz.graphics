					<h3>Summary</h3>
					<p>NIEHS is constantly going through changes with content and design. I joined as a Content
						Stratagist and moved into
						a UI/UX position. In the following projects you will see updating web pages to make them more
						friendly and applying
						USWDS along with an updated modern design.

					<h3>Top Level Pages - Design Options</h3>
					<p>The goal of re-designing the top level pages were to follow the USWDS as a requirement of U.S.
						Government
						run website.</p>
					<p><strong>Option 1</strong> - This option consists of a clean and visual design. It has more
						emphasis on the child pages and
						is specific to the top level page. This option has special containers for specific sections such
						as Hot Topics.</p>
					<p><strong>Option 2</strong> - In this concept, the emphasis is placed on the child pages two levels
						down. The layout allows
						the user to get to pages faster as well as help the user understand the hierarchy while keeping
						the page itself short.
						This option condenses special containers into call out boxes that reside in a column right of
						the main content.</p>

					<h2>Redesign Graphics and Web Pages for CHORDS</h2>
					<p>This redesign was about a re-organization of the information provided by a department in NIEHS,
						Climate and Health Outcomes Research DataSystems (CHORDS). The scientists are using GitHub to
						house their software and wanted a page to describe them in a convenient location.
					</p>
					<p>There are 3 options to meet the criteria of the client along with a few suggestions that we felt
						would help the
						scientist based on their use and needs. This includes mobile versions of the web design.

					<h3>Usability Studies</h3>
					<h4>Comparative Medicine Branch - SOPs</h4>
					<p>The Comparative Medicine Branch (CMB) had a special application to search the Standard Operating
						Procedures (SOP)
						that was widely used by departments within NIEHS and their scientists. We tested the search
						features by observing
						scientists and administrators use the search, and in some instances not using the search
						application in order
						to find the SOP they needed.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-four card-two">
					<p><strong>Findings</strong> - We found that majority users would use the website's search engine,
						bookmarks, or skip the
						applications search feature to manually search through the list provided by the application.
						This was often because they
						already knew what they were looking for or the complete opposite.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-four card-two">
					<p><strong>Pain Points</strong> - A big point for all users was not knowing when an SOP has been
						updated. Even though we
						had dates on the SOP of when it has been updated, users wanted the information to be more
						apparent.</p>
					<p>Another pain point we found was that some of the labels made sense to neither scientists nor
						administrative roles.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-four niehs-card">
					<p><strong>Solutions</strong> - The CMB SOP application was updated to include a marker of recently
						updated SOPs. We also
						updated the SOP pages to make the last date it was updated more apparent. Lastly, we implemented
						a mailing system to be
						emailed when the SOP was updated.</p>
					<p>For the filters, we had updated the list to match more concisely with the use of both
						scientists and administrators. The new list consisted of suggestions made by both parties and
						proved to be more accurate.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-four">
					<h4>Top Tasks List</h4>
					<p>The Top Task list is a list on a private government webpage that takes users to commonly used
						tasks. Both scientists and
						administrative role users under NIEHS would use the top task list.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-four card-two">
					<p><strong>Findings</strong> - Users, old and new alike found a list of links to Top Tasks to be
						frustrating and disorganized.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-four card-two">
					<p><strong>Pain Points</strong> - For old users the issue was the name of the list items made no
						sense. For example, the link
						was a suggested action rather than where the link took you. Such as getting help with IT rather
						than IT Help Desk. This was
						also an issue because it was not consistent with the rest of the list.</p>
					<p>For new users, some of the list items were abbreviated and they did not know the abbreviation.
						Even if they did know
						the list was in alpha order, and combined with actions rather than where the link would lead you
						to make it confusing to look
						through.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-four niehs-card">
					<p><strong>Solution</strong> - The solution to this problem was simple and elegant. First, all the
						links were changed to the location
						or application it led the user to. Second, the abbreviation was first followed by a dash and the
						abbreviation written out. With the
						consistency of the first part of the solution combined with the second, both new and old users
						found the Top Tasks List to be easier
						to navigate.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-four">
					<h4>Recycle Guide</h4>
					<p>The Recycle Guide was a requested application to help users properly recycle or dispose of waste.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-four card-two">
					<p><strong>Findings</strong> - The scientist who would use the recycling guide had requested an
						application to help make it easier
						to understand what to do with waste. This included the steps needed to take in order to dispose
						or recycle and where to dispose
						or recycle.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-four card-two">
					<p><strong>Pain Points</strong> - Scientists were having a tough time knowing how and where to
						recycle certain types of plastics
						and glass. They also brought up not knowing how to dispose of items. There were also concerns
						about different recycling instructions
						depending on location as well as scientist roles and administrative roles.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-four niehs-card">
					<p><strong>Solutions</strong> - When creating cards in the application, we had separated items that
						cannot be recycled with items
						that can be. To help with the pain points, we included how and where to dispose of items in the
						card once expanded.</p>
					<p>To address the concerns of location and roles, we included filters based on location. This helped
						tremendously and made it a lot
						easier for the user to filter through the cards.
